## Recommendations

### Targeted Campaign Strategies

1. **Best Months:**
   - Focus the marketing campaign on March, September, October, and possibly December. Avoid May, which had the lowest success rate.

2. **Seasonal Trend:**
   - Target marketing efforts during fall and winter, as people are more likely to subscribe to term deposits during these seasons.

3. **Limiting Calls:**
   - Implement a policy of making no more than 3 calls to the same potential client to avoid declines.

4. **Target Age Groups:**
   - Concentrate on clients in their 20s or younger and those in their 60s or older, as they are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.

5. **Occupation Focus:**
   - Prioritize students and retired individuals in the campaign, as they have shown a higher likelihood of subscribing.

6. **Balances and Loans:**
   - Target individuals with average and high balances, as they are less likely to have house loans and more likely to open a term deposit.

7. **Engaging Calls:**
   - Develop interesting questionnaires during calls to increase engagement, as call duration positively correlates with term deposit subscription.

8. **Duration Focus:**
   - Target individuals with a call duration above the average (375 seconds), as they have a high likelihood (78%) of opening a term deposit account.

## Conclusion

The next marketing campaign should be strategic, considering timing, seasonality, targeted age and occupation groups, balanced engagement during calls, and focusing on individuals with certain financial characteristics to increase the chances of term deposit subscriptions.
